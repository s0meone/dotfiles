# Dotfiles

I do a lot of development work in `tmux` and `vim` and this is my personal configuration.
Feel free to use anything you see or give me protips to improve my setup.

I've structered my dotfiles like written out in [this blogpost](https://web.archive.org/web/20220524072540/https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Configuration

My setup includes the following main components:

 * `avn`
 * `brew`
 * `nvm`
 * `pry`
 * `rbenv`
 * `the_silver_searcher` (`ag`)
 * `tmux`
 * `tmuxinator`
 * `vim`
 * `zsh`
 * `fzf`
